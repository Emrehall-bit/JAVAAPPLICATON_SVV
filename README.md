# JAVAAPPLICATON_SVV

This application is a JavaFX-based management system developed for a car rental company. Integrated with a PostgreSQL database, the system enables easy management of vehicle and driver records. Users can add, update, or delete vehicle information such as brand, model, color, and type. Similarly, drivers' identity, address, and contact information can be stored and edited in the system. Supporting full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, the application offers efficient management with a user-friendly interface and error handling. The ability to switch between vehicle and driver modules makes the system more flexible and convenient to use.
